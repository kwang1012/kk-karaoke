## Setup

For both local and docker setups, please first create/update environment variable files (Follow `.env.example` under **BOTH** frontend and backend)

### (Recommended) Docker

You can easily start the app with Docker.

```bash
docker build -t kkaraoke .
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/backend/storage:/app/backend/storage --env-file ./backend/.env kkaraoke

# For gpus (You will need this if you want to process LOTS OF SONGS!!!!)
docker build -f Dockerfile.cuda -t kkaraoke:cuda .
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/backend/storage:/app/backend/storage --env-file ./backend/.env --gpus all kkaraoke
```

### Local environment

#### Prerequisites:

1. ffmpeg in your system PATH.
2. A running redis in your system

#### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
celery -A services.process_request.celery worker -l info --concurrency=1 --pool=solo
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn start
```

### (Optional) Preprocess tracks

If you want to preprocess the tracks so that the users can immediately enjoy the vocaless music, you can preprocess the tracks in advance. 

```
cd backend
python -m scripts.process_default_queue.py
```
